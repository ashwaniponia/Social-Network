# Social-Network
A project on Graph data structure and algorithm to implement a community network in which we can 
rank the people of community according to their influence on others. 
We can also create groups of people based on common interests and hobbies of 
its members and remove the members based on their position and activities in the group. 

It also suggests friends based on:  
> Mutual Friends 
> Neighboring people 

It also gathers statistics based on the details and their activity on the network. 

For e.g.: 

  1) Age group 

  2) Number of friends (Extroverts/ Introverts)
